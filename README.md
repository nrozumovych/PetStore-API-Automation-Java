# PetStore-API-Automation-Java
Automated API testing framework for the PetStore RESTful API using Java and REST Assured.

This repository hosts an automated API testing framework developed to validate the functionality and reliability of the **PetStore RESTful API** (powered by Swagger/OpenAPI). The project demonstrates a systematic approach to API test automation, covering essential HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing pets, users, and orders, along with authentication.

**Key objectives of this project include:**
* Implementing a robust, maintainable, and scalable test automation framework using industry best practices.
* Ensuring the correctness of API responses, including status codes, data integrity, and schema validation.
* Showcasing practical skills in API testing, test data management, and comprehensive test reporting.

This framework is designed for easy execution and provides clear, actionable test results, simulating real-world API interactions.

**Comprehensive Reporting with Allure**

The framework is integrated with Allure Report to provide clear, actionable, and visually appealing test reports. This helps in quick analysis of test runs and effective communication of results to stakeholders.
